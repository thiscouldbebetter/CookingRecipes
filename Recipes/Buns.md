Buns
====

Prepare the dough as in the recipe for "Bread".

Separate the dough into six pieces, by dividing into thirds and then dividing each third in half.

Form each ball of dough into the desired shape, for example, a hamburger bun or a hot dog bun.  The buns will be smaller than their final size, but should be the same shape.

Place the buns on a cooking sheet and coat completely with oil, top, sides, and bottom.

Place the buns in a warm oven to rise for 15 minutes.

Turn the oven up to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and cook for 15 minutes.

If desired, turn on the oven's, upper, broiler element and broil the tops until browned slightly, perhaps with the oven door open.
