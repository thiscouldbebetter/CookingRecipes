Tortillas
=========

Prepare the dough as in the recipe for "Bread".

Divide the dough into two pieces, then each of the those pieces into two pieces, then each of those pieces into two pieces, to make 8 balls.

Flour the countertop and roll out each ball into a circle of about 8 inches.

Cook each tortilla on a oiled or buttered griddle or pan using medium-high heat, until each side has a few brown spots.
