Rice
====

In a pot, add 1 part by volume of rice to 2 parts water.

Heat until boiling, then cover the pot turn down the heat to low.

Simmer until the rice is at the desired consistence, perhaps 20 minutes.  This should be around the time when no liquid water remains in the pot.  To check, it may be necessary to dig the rice out of the way with a fork or spoon to verify that no water is present in the bottom of the pot.
