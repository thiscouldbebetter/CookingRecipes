Chocolate-Chip Cookies
======================

In a mixing bowl, melt 1 stick (4 ounces) of butter.

Mix in 3/4 cup of sugar, with the desired proportion of white granulated sugar to packed brown sugar.

Beat in 1 egg.

Mix in flour until the dough only sticks to the hands a bit.

Mix in 6 ounces (half a standard bag) of chocolate chips.

If desired, chill the dough in the refrigerator until it is easier to handle.

Roll the dough into balls 1 inch in diameter.

Arrange the balls onto a baking sheet.

Cook at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes or until no longer shiny.
