Cream of Potato Soup
====================

Dice roughly 2 pounds of potatoes (perhaps four medium potatoes).

Add the diced potatoes to a pot, cover with water, and boil until they are soft enough to mash, perhaps 20 minutes.

While the potatoes are boiling, in another pan, melt 2 ounces of butter.

Mix in 2 ounces of flour to create a roux.

Heat the roux until it bubbles, then continue until the flour is cooked, perhaps one minute, stirring constantly to prevent sticking.

Add 1 cup of milk.

Heat the mixture of milk and roux until it thickens, stirring constantly.  The resulting sauce is called "bechamel".

Drain and roughly mash the potatoes, perhaps with a fork.

Mix a cup and a half of broth into the bechamel sauce.

Add the mashed potatoes to the mixture of broth and bechamel.

Boil the soup to the desired thickness.

If desired, add perhaps eight ounces of sausage, making sure that it has enough time to cook.
