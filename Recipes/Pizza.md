Pizza
=====

Prepare pizza sauce by diluting tomato paste with water until it is spreadable, adding salt and, if desired, spices like oregano, garlic, onion, basil and pepper.

Prepare the dough as in the recipe for "Bread", except double the recipe.  For a chewy pizza crust, it is especially important to use a high-gluten bread flour.

On a well-floured surface, roll the dough into a round perhaps 1/4 inch thick and 18 inches in diameter, dusting with flour as necessary.  Alternatively, the dough can be stretched by hand.

Transfer the dough onto a metal baking screen at least as large as the crust.  Top with pizza sauce, toppings, and mozzarella cheese.  Be careful not to take too long to add toppings after placing the crust on the screen, or to press the dough down too hard, or the dough will sink into the screen and be difficult to remove after baking.

Cook the pizza in an oven preheated to 425 degrees Fahrenheit for about 14 minutes, or until the first brown spots start to appear on the cheese.
